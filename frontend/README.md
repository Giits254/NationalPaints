# National Paints Inventory  Management Software

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run electron-dev`
To run the app as a desktop app in the developmentenvironment

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run electron-prod`
This is for testing the app to see if your producton build is well configured. This command will not run the app on localhost but will run it as static files from the build folder. It will also open as a desktop app

### `npm run electron-pack`
To package the app. This is a standalone app that uses python and flask backend. For you to package this app, you need to have embedded python 3.10 in you frontend folder. Create a folder named 'python-win-x64' in the frontend folder, extract the the contents of embeded python there, (you can download the embedded python on python official page). You also have to install modules in the requirements.txt(you can find it in the backend folder) to this embedded python environment. 

After running this command on your terminal, and installable app will be created in the dist folder, you can install the app to you system

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
